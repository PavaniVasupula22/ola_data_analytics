# ola_data_analytics
This project is an end-to-end data analysis of a ride-sharing app's dataset, similar to what a data analyst would do at a company like Ola. The primary objective is to transform raw ride data into actionable business insights that can improve operational efficiency, enhance customer and driver satisfaction, and optimize pricing strategies.
By completing this project, you will demonstrate proficiency in the entire data analysis lifecycle, from initial data cleaning and exploratory analysis to advanced statistical modeling and compelling data visualization.

The Business Problem
The ride-sharing industry is highly competitive and dynamic. To maintain a competitive edge, it's essential to understand and act on data. This project addresses the following critical business questions:

Operational Efficiency: How do we optimize driver supply to meet demand? What are the peak hours and locations for ride requests?

Customer Behavior: What factors influence ride cancellations? Can we identify and target different customer segments?

Revenue & Pricing: How do surge pricing and other factors affect the total fare and ride volume? What is the overall profitability of the service?
